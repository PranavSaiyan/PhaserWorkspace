Phaser

Phaser is a free software 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile. It is developed by Photon Storm. Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and can automatically swap between them based on browser support. This allows for fast rendering across desktop and mobile.
